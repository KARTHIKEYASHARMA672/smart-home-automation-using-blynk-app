This ESP8266-based home automation system uses Blynk to control four relays via Wi-Fi. Each relay, connected to pins D1–D4, can switch appliances ON/OFF remotely from the Blynk app or web dashboard. The system uses virtual pins V0–V3 for control, enabling easy, real-time, wireless management of home devices.
